            <p>I was born from two young parents in <b>Tallahassee, Florida</b> where I lived until the summer after my freshman year of high school.<br>
                
            I completed my high school career in <b>Orlando, Florida</b> at <i>Olympia High School</i>. The quality schooling I received in Orlando set me on a path towards the <i>University of Florida</i> where I now attend.</p>

        <div class="sub-section bg-three">
            <p>As a child I was always interested in art and building LEGOs. I originally thought that I would take those two passions of mine and become an architect.<br>
                
            Once in high school, I began taking drafting classes to learn more about design and AutoCAD. As a consequence of this, I realized that I could use my new skills to become a mechanical engineer, which I felt was a more sound career choice.<br>
                
            Once at the <i>University of Florida</i> I became involved in the Audio Engineering Society where I was surrounded by ECE students. My involvement led to realizing Computer Engineering best aligned with my interests.</p>

            <p>In my spare time I like to get involved in student organizations such as the Audio Engineering Society and the National Society of Black Engineers Gator Chapter.<br>
                
            Outside of school, I enjoy critically analyzing music, learning instruments, and writing songs as well as other more recreational activities such as skateboarding, basketball, and video games.</p>
